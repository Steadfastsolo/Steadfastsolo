## About Me 🔐
📟 Hi, I’m David Brendan Augustin, a B.S. Computer Science student at the University of Georgia. 
I’m currently pursuing a strong foundation in software development while planning to complete a certificate in cybersecurity & privacy. 
Right now my current project is a full-stack Wordle clone to strengthen my backend architecture, API design, and frontend integration skills.

🎮 Besides my academic pursuits, I also enjoy learning new skills such as 3D modelling and game development.
I hope to release my own comercial game in the future and maybe even start a 3D printing buissness. 

🥾 I also enjoy going on hiking trails and vacations around the world with my friends and family.

## My Involvment 🏫
In UGA I participate in a variety of clubs and student organizations:
* HackThePack, a cybersecurity-focused student organization centered on CTF / cybersecurity competitions, hands-on security labs, 
  and collaborative learning in areas like network security, cryptography, reverse engineering, and more.
* Dev Dogs, a student-run club at UGA dedicated to benefiting the local community through code.
* Game Builders Club, a student organization dedicated to helping students learn all there is to know about video game design.
